The goal of TemplateR is to just provide a simple template to create your own R package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of TemplateR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tiagomaie/TemplateR")
```

## Usage

You download this repository change the name of the package to your own package
and adjust whatever options you want to adjust (you should create your own git repo)
and you can start using it as your own.

Most of the boring tasks related to package management are taken care by the
`make pkg_pipeline` command that you can run from the command line.
